Airbnb-like Property Rental Platform
Project Overview: This project is an Airbnb-like property rental platform, allowing users to browse, list, and book rental properties.

Key features include:
Property Listings: Browse detailed rental properties with images and pricing.
User Authentication: Secure login and registration for owners and renters.
Direct Booking: Contact property owners directly to book rooms.
Review System: Leave reviews and ratings for properties.
Technology Stack:
Frontend: Developed with React.js, providing a responsive and dynamic user interface.
Backend: Built using Node.js and Express.js to handle server-side logic and API requests.
Database: MongoDB is used for efficient data management of users and property listings.

Important Note about Render:

Render is a cloud platform that hosts the backend. The free tier of Render may experience a cold start when itâ€™s accessed for the first time after being idle for a while. This means that when you first make a request to the backend, it may take a minute or two for the server to start up properly.
Please be patient when accessing the backend for the first time. Subsequent requests should be much faster as Render keeps the server running after the initial startup.
